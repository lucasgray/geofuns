# Dronemap

This project is a typescript CRA webapp featuring `react-map-gl` and `deck.gl`.  

Given an api, it renders a map view of POIs (points of interest) and drone travel paths. An end user can use the UI to analyze the results of the mission and classify the POIs discovered. 

## To Run

In this directory, `pnpm install & npm run dev` will start the webapp (and only the webapp).
